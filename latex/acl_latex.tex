\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Multi-turn agents often require many LLM calls, making the cost--quality trade-off a first-class concern.
We study \emph{multi-turn model routing}: selecting which model to call at each step of an episode based on the interaction history.
We describe a modular evaluation framework with an explicit routing layer and a learned router trained from offline trajectories to optimize a cost-adjusted objective.
This draft focuses on the models, dataset, split protocol, and method; full experimental results are deferred.

to the document fonts. See Figure~\ref{fig:experiments} for an example of a figure and its caption.

Using the \verb|graphicx| package graphics files can be included within figure
environment at an appropriate point within the text.
The \verb|graphicx| package supports various optional arguments to control the
appearance of the figure.
You must include it explicitly in the \LaTeX{} preamble (after the
\verb|\documentclass| declaration and before \verb|\begin{document}|) using
\verb|\usepackage{graphicx}|.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example-image-golden}
  \caption{A figure with a caption that runs for more than one line.
    Example image is usually available through the \texttt{mwe} package
    without even mentioning it in the preamble.}
  \label{fig:experiments}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{example-image-a} \hfill
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{example-image-b}
  \caption {A minimal working example to demonstrate how to place
    two images side-by-side.}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation:
\begin{quote}
\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
\end{quote}
This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.

\subsection{Citations}

\begin{table*}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \hline
    \textbf{Output}           & \textbf{natbib command} & \textbf{ACL only command} \\
    \hline
    \citep{Gusfield:97}       & \verb|\citep|           &                           \\
    \citealp{Gusfield:97}     & \verb|\citealp|         &                           \\

    \citeposs{Gusfield:97}    &                         & \verb|\citeposs|          \\

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{citation-guide}
    Citation commands supported by the style file.
    The style is based on the natbib package and supports all natbib citation commands.
    It also supports commands defined in previous ACL style files for compatibility.
  }
\end{table*}

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

A possessive citation can be made with the command \verb|\citeposs|.
This is not a standard natbib command, so it is generally not compatible
with other style files.

\subsection{References}

\nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly follow the American Psychological Association format.
If your own bib file is named \texttt{custom.bib}, then placing the following before any appendices in your \LaTeX{} file will generate the references section for you:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{custom}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

You can obtain the complete ACL Anthology as a Bib\TeX{} file from \url{https://aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib.gz}.
To include both the Anthology and your own .bib file, use the following instead of the above.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{anthology,custom}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Please see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex} for information on preparing Bib\TeX{} files.

\subsection{Equations}

An example equation is shown below:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:example}
  A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.

This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}.

\subsection{Appendices}

Use \verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} for an example.

\section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
\label{sec:bibtex}

Unicode cannot be used in Bib\TeX{} entries, and some ways of typing special characters can disrupt Bib\TeX's alphabetization. The recommended way of typing special characters is shown in Table~\ref{tab:accents}.

Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible, and for all the ACL materials that you reference.
Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.
