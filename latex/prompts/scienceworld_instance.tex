Complete the science experiment described above. You are interacting with a simulated environment.
Issue commands one at a time and observe the results.

**Tip:** Use query commands like `?navigation` or `?object` to explore available actions without consuming a turn.

**Strategy hints:**
- First explore: use "open door to [room]" then "go to [room]" to navigate
- Look around each room to find objects you need
- Pick up objects with "pick up [object]"
- For heating: find a stove, turn it on with "activate [stove]", place container on it
- For cooling: use a freezer or refrigerator
- Use "focus on [object]" to examine substances

To complete the task, perform the necessary actions described in the task description.
When you believe the task is complete, issue the command:

```text
task completed
```

Remember:
- Think step by step about what actions are needed
- Explore your environment to find needed objects
- Some actions may require prerequisites (e.g., picking up an object before using it)
