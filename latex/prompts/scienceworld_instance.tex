Complete the science experiment described above. You are interacting with a simulated environment.
Issue commands one at a time and observe the results.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Tip}: Use query commands like \texttt{?navigation} or \texttt{?object} to explore available actions without consuming a turn.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Strategy hints:}
\begin{itemize}
\item First explore: use \texttt{open door to [room]} then \texttt{go to [room]} to navigate
\item Look around each room to find objects you need
\item Pick up objects with \texttt{pick up [object]}
\item For heating: find a stove, turn it on with \texttt{activate [stove]}, place container on it
\item For cooling: use a freezer or refrigerator
\item Use \texttt{focus on [object]} to examine substances
\end{itemize}

To complete the task, perform the necessary actions described in the task description.
When you believe the task is complete, issue the command:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\texttt{```text} \\
\texttt{task completed} \\
\texttt{```}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Remember:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Think step by step about what actions are needed
\item Explore your environment to find needed objects
\item Some actions may require prerequisites (e.g., picking up an object before using it)
\end{itemize}
