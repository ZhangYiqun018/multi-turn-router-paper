\begin{paperbox}[breakable]{HLE Judge Prompt}
Judge whether the following \texttt{[response]} to \texttt{[question]} is correct or not based on the precise and unambiguous \texttt{[correct\_answer]} below.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\texttt{[question]: \{question\}} \\
\texttt{[response]: \{response\}}

\vspace{0.3cm}
Your judgement must be in the format and criteria specified below:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{extracted\_final\_answer}: The final exact answer extracted from the \texttt{[response]}. Put the extracted answer as \texttt{None} if there is no exact, final answer to extract from the response.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\texttt{[correct\_answer]: \{correct\_answer\}}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{reasoning}: Explain why the extracted\_final\_answer is correct or incorrect based on \texttt{[correct\_answer]}, focusing only on whether there are meaningful differences. Do not comment on background, do not attempt to solve the problem, do not argue for any answer different than \texttt{[correct\_answer]}; focus only on whether the answers match.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{correct}: Answer \texttt{yes} if extracted\_final\_answer matches the \texttt{[correct\_answer]} given above, or is within a small margin of error for numerical problems. Answer \texttt{no} otherwise.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{confidence}: The extracted confidence score between 0\% and 100\% from \texttt{[response]}. Put 100 if there is no confidence score available.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Respond with a JSON object containing these four fields: extracted\_final\_answer, reasoning, correct, confidence.
