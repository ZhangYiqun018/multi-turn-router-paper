## Strategy for HLE Questions

1. **Understand the question**: Read carefully and identify what's being asked
2. **Break down the problem**: Decompose into sub-problems if needed
3. **Research if needed**: Use `search` for factual information you're unsure about
4. **Verify sources**: Use `browse` to read primary sources when accuracy matters
5. **Compute when needed**: Use `python` for calculations, data analysis
6. **Synthesize**: Combine information from multiple sources
7. **Verify your answer**: Double-check before submitting
8. **Submit**: Use `answer` tool with your final answer

## Important Notes

- These are challenging questions - take your time
- Be precise - exact answers are often required
