We presented a modular framework for evaluating multi-turn agents with an explicit model routing layer and described a learned routing approach trained from offline trajectories under a cost-adjusted objective.
Ongoing work includes completing broader benchmark coverage and reporting full experimental results across in-distribution and OOD splits.
