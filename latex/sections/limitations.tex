This draft does not yet report comprehensive experimental results, ablations, or statistical significance tests.
The current implementation and protocols are primarily validated on ScienceWorld; generalization to additional benchmarks and broader model pools remains ongoing.
Finally, routing decisions are trained from logged trajectories, and distribution shift between collection policies and deployment-time routing can introduce bias without careful off-policy correction.
